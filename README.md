# MERN-stack-Chat-app

In this project, I have made a full stack chat app with different co-functionalities. I made it from scratch using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node. It will be a chat app with a lot of distinct features like online indicator,uploads/attachments, auto-scrolling and many others.

For the client side of the project I have used Vite and React.js. And for styling I have used Tailwind CSS. In register, login page I have used JSON web token and MongoDB for authentication.

For the main part of the application which is the chat page which comes after the login page. I have implemented WebSocket communication and authenticated WebSocket connection in the MERN app.
